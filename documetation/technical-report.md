# Technical Report: Overcoming Resource Constraints

## The Challenge:
As a student in Mozambique with no access to:
- Formal engineering education
- Well-equipped lab
- Commercial components
- Reliable internet

## My Solution:
1. Used salvaged components from old electronics
2. Learned programming on Android Termux
3. Studied from free PDF books
4. Built system incrementally

## Results:
- Functional obstacle detection system
- Machine learning integration
- Real-time processing
- Total cost: < $20
